INSTRUMENT_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
Extract all visible FRONT-SIDE payment instruments from the image.
The image can be rotated, sideways, cropped, or can contain multiple instruments on one page.

Skip and do not include:
- Back pages: service charge text, load-this-direction arrows, endorsement panels, "for deposit only" stamps,
  purchaser agreement text, security-feature/legal disclosure pages.
- Deposit tickets/forms, deposit slips, deposit receipts, Chase ATM receipts, batch/register pages, blank pages.
- Pre-printed deposit-ticket forms at the top of a mixed page are NOT checks; do not create an instrument for them even if they have a MICR line or total box.
- Regions "Details of Deposits by Account" pages with Capture Seq/R/T/Post Amount/Credit Amount tables.
- Bleed-through text from the other side of a money order.

Important extraction rules:
- Extract only fields physically visible on the page image.
- A page can contain one, two, three, or more instruments. Return one object per front-side instrument.
- Amount must come from a labeled amount box or written amount words. MICR/routing/account numbers are never amounts.
- Preserve cents exactly. If the amount box visually shows separated cents like "$356 56", return 356.56, not 356.00.
- If written amount words clearly disagree with numeric amount, trust the written amount words.
- Set amount_evidence="both" only when the numeric box and legal amount words independently agree.
- If only one amount source is readable, identify that source. If neither is clear, return amount_numeric=null.
- Serial/document numbers may begin with any digits, including 20. Read the complete visibly labeled number; never infer a prefix from issuer examples.
- MoneyGram serial is usually top-right/check-number area. Do not confuse vertical form numbers with the serial.
- For cashier/personal checks, serial_number is the check number, usually top-right and/or final MICR group.
- For checks, routing and account numbers are never serial_number.
- payee_raw is the property/community name only. If the payee line also has an apartment/unit number, put that number in unit.
- unit is an apartment/unit identifier, usually 3-5 digits, from payee line, purchaser address, memo, payment-for/account field, or handwritten notes.
- payer_name is the purchaser/remitter/drawer name, not labels like "purchaser", "remitter", or "address".
- Return null instead of hallucinating unreadable names or digits.

Strict rules:
- Return an object only for a clearly visible front-side instrument.
- Do not return deposit slips, receipts, registers, backs, partial neighboring
  instruments, or bleed-through.
- Never infer or complete hidden digits. Use null for every unreadable field.
- amount_numeric must be visibly supported by an amount box or amount words.
- serial_number must be visibly supported by a labeled document/check/serial
  number or the check-number portion of the MICR line.
- If the crop contains only a fragment and cannot establish an amount plus a
  separate identity field, return {"instruments": []}.

- Do NOT return the aggregate credit row as a physical payment item. It can be included only if is_deposit_total=true.
- All later rows with Item Type like 0003 or Debit are physical deposited payment items.
- Use the printed row amount above each thumbnail as amount_numeric. Do not use handwritten amount in the thumbnail when the row amount is visible.
- Preserve cents exactly. $294.36 must remain 294.36, not 294.56.

  followed by "EIGHTY-FIVE DOLLARS 00 CENTS" is exactly 385.00.
- If numeric box and written amount disagree, prefer written amount only when it is clearly legible; otherwise set confidence below 0.70.
